# ðŸš€ Course Overview

## Welcome to Rocket Basics!

[Coding Basics](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/basics) is Rocket Academy's introduction to programming and computational thinking.

Basics will enable you to understand the logic of the fundamental syntax of any computing language through considering Web Development, the larger concept taught thoroughly by Rocket's [Software Engineering Bootcamp](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/bootcamp).

There are many paths of software engineering of which Web Development is a simpler one to understand because everyone interacts with the World Wide Web, our internet, on a daily basis.

In this course we will learn basic coding concepts through building simple programs. You can consider [applying to join our Bootcamp](logistics/post-course/bootcamp-admission-criteria.md) after Basics to build more complex programs, gain full understanding of how applications are made, and even get a formal software engineering job.

## What will Basics cover?

Basics aims to incrementally level-up students' coding knowledge through fun game-based mini projects. This happens in a "sandbox" environment meant to focus on the universal, fundamental concepts of programming, rather than being specific to the any one language.

Coding Basics consists of 6 Modules and 3 Projects.

## What will Basics not cover?

Coding Basics does not cover entry-level Computer Science. At Rocket Academy, you will be learning via a middle-out approach, and you will learn by doing. This course will not deep dive into _how or why_ a computer operates. [Computer Science is to programming what organic chemistry is to cooking](https://blog.codegiant.io/building-a-software-is-like-cooking-food-a64461a2e791?gi=ddfba8e218fc). If this was a cooking course, we will be teaching you how to cook an omelette, not why the egg fries at a certain temperature. You will also likely make a mess.

The following areas are covered in depth in Rocket's Software Engineering Bootcamp and not in Coding Basics:

1. Industry-standard, production-level app building and software architecture.
2. Advanced data structures and algorithms, such as those relevant for coding interviews.
