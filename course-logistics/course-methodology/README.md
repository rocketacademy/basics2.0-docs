# 🏫 Course Methodology

## How will Basics work?

1. You have the option to complete Basics in a self-serve or guided manner. Students that wish to self-serve can go through the course material at their own pace. The guided course is 5 weeks long with 10 meetings of 2 hours each and roughly 10 hours of work per week.
2. You will write code in a browser-based code editor with starter code provided by Rocket. We will primarily code in the JavaScript language, [the world's most popular programming language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies), but the concepts we learn are universal.
3. You will learn primarily by writing code. Lessons are pre-recorded, guided class sessions are spent coding with peers, and students will work on exercises and projects outside of class.

## Class Organisation

Each cohort will be split into sections of no more than 20 students. Each section will be led by a section leader from Rocket, who will be the primary point of contact for that section during Coding Basics, and assisted by an Assistant Section Leader. Sections are assigned randomly and fixed for the duration of the course. Students will meet with their respective sections for classes to maximise interaction and learning. Students will be able to interact with students from other sections via Slack.
