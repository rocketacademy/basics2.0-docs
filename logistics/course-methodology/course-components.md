## Flipped-Classroom Model

Coding Basics applies a flipped-classroom model that consists of 2 components: **self-learning** and **live classes**.

### Self-Learning

The goal of self-learning is for students to learn concepts **before** class, such that class time can be spent discussing those concepts. Students who do not complete the the pre-class readings and exercises before the live class may affect the experience for the rest of the Section, especially when it comes to [pair programming](course-components.md#pair-programming).

It is recommended that you attempt to complete the pre-class work _at least_ a day before the scheduled live class, so that you can ask questions early in Slack.

### **Live Classes**

The objective of live classes is to enable students to gain a better understanding of the concepts learnt during self-learning through instructor facilitated discussion and pair-programming exercises.

They will be held over Zoom.

Live classes will generally follow this outline:

1. 30 minutes for students to explain and review concepts with the section
2. 85 minutes of pair programming on in-class exercises with a designated peer
3. 5 minutes for students to ask any questions that they might have about the day's class, and for the instructor to preview the next class

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a common software engineering activity that involves 2 engineers working on the same computer, on the same problem, together. Typically, 1 engineer acts as the "driver", controlling the keyboard and writing the code. The other engineer acts as the "navigator", helping to guide the overall strategy and look up documentation.

Pair programming is commonly used for the following purposes:

1. To share knowledge across teams or between juniors and seniors, where the navigator is typically more knowledgeable about that part of the system than the driver.
2. To ensure an important piece of software gets done correctly. Sometimes, for difficult software engineering problems with large future repercussions, it is more worth it to spend 2 engineers' time to get it right, than to spend 1 engineer's time and risk getting it wrong.

During Coding Basics, we will use pair programming to solidify our understanding of concepts by coding and explaining in front of each other. The majority of class time will be spent pair programming in designated pairs. Pairings change throughout the course, and are planned by Section Leaders.

You can refer to [Pair Programming Instructions](broken-reference) to see how this will be done virtually.
