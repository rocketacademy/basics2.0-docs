# ðŸŽ² Exercises and Projects

## Overview

Coding Basics is conceptually designed to have a **"low floor, high ceiling".** The intent is to keep the course accessible to most students, while students with a stronger background, aptitude or spare time are able and allowed to stretch their wings.

Exercises and projects are designed with this in mind, and the core curriculum is seeded with links to auxiliary reading or material that will be covered later in the course. Every module is also accompanied by a list of Additional Resources.

Students are not expected to read every resource, complete every exercise, or perfect every project in Coding Basics.

Students who are comfortable with the core curriculum and learn outside of the scope or ahead of the course are encouraged to share their learning with the rest of the Section.

## Exercise, Project Strategy

### Base, Comfortable, More Comfortable

To accommodate different learning speeds and prior experience, exercises and projects may have different sections to differentiate what must be completed to minimally understand concepts, and what are extra exercises or features to help solidify one's understanding.

#### Base

Everything in the Base section must be completed to minimally understand relevant concepts. When short on time, we can complete the Base section then move onto the next exercise or project.

#### Comfortable

The comfortable section usually involves core concepts in a challenging or new way. Students are encouraged to attempt the Comfortable sections, _once they are feeling comfortable._

#### More Comfortable

The More Comfortable section is for students that wish to push their boundaries. Often times this section requires learning outside of concepts taught thus far. Students can complete Coding Basics without touching More Comfortable.

## Project Presentations

Students present projects in class on the last day of each project. Presentations should cover the following.

1. Demonstration of the application and/or feature
2. Biggest challenges faced while developing the project
3. What they might do differently next time, or if given more time

In order to keep each presentation relatively brief, the presentation should be focused around the _features_ of the game. The presentation is not a code review, as that would take up too much time.

## Code Review

On days when projects are due, we will review each others' code in groups of 2 or 3 during class. If there is a group of 3, the triplet will do individual code review together so that everyone gets to review someone else's code, then split into 2 groups for pairing.

### Individual Review

#### 1) Exchange CodeSandbox links

You may follow the instructions here:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### 2) Run Partner's Code

Test the code in the sandboxed browser. What does it do? If you're not sure what it does, look inside `script.js` to see.

#### 3) Read Partner's Code

Read the code and answer the following questions.

1. How does it work?
2. Does it have any obvious errors?
3. Does it implement something that you were trying to do?
4. Does it implement a feature that you haven't started yet? How does the code work?

#### 4) Play with Partner's Code

It may be helpful to make changes to the code to help you understand it better. Inject some `console.log` within the code to help you figure out what the code does. Break the code in a certain way to prove how it works or doesn't work.

#### 5) Discuss

Once both partners are done with #1-4, discuss:

* What was interesting about his/her implementation of the code to resolve the problem?
* Are there logical errors / edge cases that you picked up that could help make the code more versatile?
* Is there a better, or simpler way of doing things?

### Peer Review

You'll be pair programming on one person's project at a time. The goal is to get working versions for each person. **The driver will be the person who is \*not\* working on their own code.**

Once done with one person's code, send the code to your pair (it's their project) via a [Slack code snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/slack-tips/share-code-snippets). Switch to work on the other person's code.

If you both have working versions, implement a new feature in one of the projects together.
