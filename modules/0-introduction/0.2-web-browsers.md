# 0.2: Web Browsers

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Explain what a web browser is in your own words.
* [ ] Explain what role browsers play in this course, and why we use them.
* [ ] Make simple edits to an HTML file and see those changes reflected in your browser.

## What is a Web browser?

A web browser is a program used to view and interact with web pages. A web browser is a purpose-built application; just like Windows Media Player or iTunes are built to handle audio or video files, web browsers are built to handle HTML and related files.

A web browser is used to _browse_ for files on the _web._ If we abstract "the web" as just computers connected together, a browser fundamentally browses files on computers. You can browse files on your own computer by typing `C://` or `file://` in the browser navigation bar for Windows and MacOS, respectively.

When you visit YouTube to watch a video, you are _browsing_ to a connected computer which has the video you want saved into memory.

### Why learn about web browsers?

In Coding Basics we will use browsers as a learning tool to visualise inputs and outputs of our code through web pages. **In general, web browsers are not necessary for writing and executing code.**

## HTML

We will very briefly touch on HTML and what how web browsers process them, and dive deeper into HTML in [Module 5.](../5-html-and-css/5.1-html.md)

HTML stands for HyperText _Markup_ Langauge. An HTML file is simply a text file, you can open HTML files with notepad or other simple text-processing applications. Markup means that the text is presented to the user as more than just plain text: it involves structure and formatting. Almost all websites are rendered using HTML. Browsers were invented to download and render HTML on computers. HTML is **not** a programming language, but it can easily work with JavaScript, which is a programming language.

The programs we will build in Coding Basics will rely on HTML to accept inputs and visualise outputs. The programs we will build will be written in JavaScript.

## Exercises

### Run Starter Code in CodeSandbox

1. Refer to[initial-setup.md](../../logistics/learning-environment/initial-setup.md "mention") if you have not set up your CodeSandbox environment.
2. You should see a list of folders, `index.html` , `script.js`, and `styles.css` .
3. Click on `index.html` and scroll down to line `63` . Edit (Basics!) to something else. Saving the file with trigger Hot-Reload, and will refresh the page in the browser automatically.
4. Change the text of the button on line `82`.

### Open a HTML File

1. Right-click on this webpage and save it as a HTML file somewhere on your computer.
2. Open up the saved HTML file using a web browser. What do you see?
   1. You can also use your web browser to _browse_ to the file by typing `C://` for Windows or `file://` for MacOS in your browser's address bar, and then navigating to the saved file. \`\`

### Questions

1. When you click "Next" to navigate to the following page, what is the input? What instructions are you giving the Web Browser? What is the output?
