## Hello world

Here we will learning about coding. This module was carefully crafted to help properly summarize major concepts within the web into bite sized content for you to form a fundamental understanding and becoming a spring board for you to dig deeper through more reading **at your own time**!&#x20;

This module is optional. However, we want to encourage you at least give the content here a skim through in order to have context to what you are doing, and why you are doing what you're doing.

&#x20;is not mandatory for you to read, but we've compiled the vast&#x20;
