# 3.2.1: If, Else, Else If

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

* [ ] Understand and use the `if, else, else if` statements.

## If Statement

An "**if statement**" is a control-flow "**code block**" that runs if a condition is `true`. A code block is a section of code surrounded by curly braces. We'll talk more about what `true` means later in [Module 4.3: Boolean And, Not](../3.3-boolean-operators/3.3.3-boolean-and-not.md#boolean-values).

### Simple Conditional Example: Secret Phrase

Let's write a program that changes the output value of `"hello world"` if we did not type in the secret phrase.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  // Set a default value for myOutputValue
  var myOutputValue = 'hello world';
  // If input is our secret phrase, change the value of myOutputValue
  if (input == 'palatable papaya') {
    myOutputValue = 'you wrote the secret phrase!';
  }
  // return myOutputValue as output
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

The if statement on line 5 has the conditional that tests if `input` is equal to `'palatable papaya'`.

If `input` is equal to `'palatable papaya'`, the code runs between the curly braces on lines 5 and 7, i.e. the "**if block**".\
If `input` is not equal to our phrase, the if block does not run.

Code blocks may or may not run depending on control flow. The 1st way we learned to use code blocks was with functions. If-statements are a 2nd way. We'll learn a 3rd code block syntax later in [3.4: Loops](../3.4-loops/3.4.1-while-loops.md).

Try inputting secret and non-secret phrases into the program. Enter the secret phrase and click the button to see `'you wrote the secret phrase!'`. Enter anything else and click the button to see the default output `hello world`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note the distinction in our code example between variable _**declaration**_ and _**assignment**_. On line 2 we "declare" the variable `myOutputValue` with the `var` keyword. This creates the named container that we can store values inside. On line 5 we "assign" a new value to the `myOutputValue` container. The old value is overwritten and non-retrievable. Notice that declaration with the `var` keyword is only done _once_ per variable. Please do not use `var` when assigning new values to existing variables.
{% endhint %}

## Dice Game

Let's build a program to guess dice rolls. We will start simple: the user guesses the number the computer rolls.\
\
To build the dice game, we can expand on the [Random Dice Roll example](../3.1-intro-to-control-flow#random-dice-rolls) from [3.1 Intro to Logic and Control Flow](../3.1-intro-to-control-flow).

```javascript
var rollDice = function () {
  // Generate a decimal from 0 through 6, inclusive of 0 and exclusive of 6.
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  // Remove the decimal with the floor operation.
  // This will be an integer from 0 to 5 inclusive.
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  // Add 1 to get valid dice rolls of 1 through 6 inclusive.
  var diceNumber = randomInteger + 1;

  return diceNumber;
};
```

### Dice Game Logic

Let's implement the logical rules to our dice game. If the user enters the same number as the dice roll, they win.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  // Generate a random dice number
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  // Default output value is 'you lose'.
  var myOutputValue = 'you lose';

  // If input matches randomDiceNumber, update output.
  if (input == randomDiceNumber) {
    myOutputValue = 'you win';
  }

  // Return output.
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Else Statement

An "**else statement**" is a control-flow "**code block**" that runs if preceding `if and else if` conditions are `false`.

### Simple Conditional Example: Secret Phrase

Let's write a program that returns the output value of `"the door shall not open"` if we type in wrong phrase.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  // Set a default value for myOutputValue
  var myOutputValue = 'hello world';
  // If input is our secret phrase, change the value of myOutputValue
  if (input == 'palatable papaya') {
    myOutputValue = 'you wrote the secret phrase!';
  }
  else{
    myOutputValue ='the door shall not open!';
  }
  
  // return myOutputValue as output
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

If the input for line 5 is not `palatable papaya`, the code on line 9 will run instead of line 6, assigning `'the door shall not open!'` as the `myOutputValue` variable.

Instead of using an initial default value like in the previous example, the else block can be used to assign an alternate `myOutputValue` for when the "**if block**" fails.

Try inputting secret and non-secret phrases into the program.

## Else-If Statement

An "**else-if statement**" is a control-flow "**code block**" that runs if the `if` condition is `false` and is used to specify additional conditions so that other "**code blocks**" may run.

### Simple Conditional Example: Secret Phrase

Let's write a program that have multiple alternative output values.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  // Set a default value for myOutputValue
  var myOutputValue = 'the door shall not open.';
  // If input is our secret phrase, change the value of myOutputValue
  if (input == 'palatable papaya') {
    myOutputValue = 'you wrote the secret phrase!';
  }
  else if (input == 'not so palatable papaya'){
    myOutputValue += ' but you are nearly there.'
  }
  else{
    myOutputValue +=' nope, this is far from the right phrase.';
  }
  
  // return myOutputValue as output
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

If the input for line 5 is `not so palatable papaya`, the code on line 9 will run instead of line 6.

In this example, the `else if` block would add on to the default values of line 3 so that `myOutputValue = 'the door shall not open. but you are nearly there'`

Line 12 in the `else` block will not run at all unless we input a value that is not `'palatable papaya'` or `'not so palatable papaya'`

Try inputting phrases into the program to get the three different outputs.

## Exercises

### **Follow Along**

Duplicate and run the code above.

### Twice the guess

Update our dice game logic such that the user wins if the dice roll is 2 times the guess, e.g. a guess of 1 and roll of 2, a guess of 2 and roll of 4, etc. To win this updated game for a 6-sided dice, the user should only guess numbers between 1 and 3, but the game does not restrict what the user can guess.
