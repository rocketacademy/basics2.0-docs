# 3.2.3 Strict Equality ===

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand the difference between the equality `==` and strict equality `===` operands
2. Decide when to use `==` and `===`

### Equality

The equality operator (==) checks if the two operands left and right are equal, returning a `true` or `false` value.

We've been using the "[**comparison operator**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js\_comparisons.asp)" `==` to test if `input` is equal to `'palatable papaya'`.

```javascript
if (input == 'palatable papaya') {
    myOutputValue = 'you wrote the secret phrase!';
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For the purpose of this course, `==` will suffice, but you are free to explore and experiment. You can read more about the differences in the following section.

### Strict Equality&#x20;

Strict equality (===) performs like equality with the exception that is considers operands of different **types** to be different. We will learn more about data types and converting from one type to another in [3.7: Input Validation.](../3.7-input-validation.md)

For comparisons between strings, usage between (==) and (===) are the same. More differences will be observed when comparing other types

```javascript
console.log('1' == 1);
// true

console.log('1' === 1);
// false as '1' is a string and 1 is a number

console.log('papaya' == 'papaya');
// true as contents are the same

console.log('papaya' === 'papaya');
// true as contents are the same and both left and right operands are strings

console.log(0 == false);
// true as 0 is falsy, to be described in future module

console.log(0 === false);
// false as 0 is a Number while false is a Boolean type

```
