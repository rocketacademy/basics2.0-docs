# 3.2: Conditionals

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

* [ ] Know how logic is used to make programs more complex
* [ ] Understand and use the `if` statement.
* [ ] Understand and use the equality operator: `==`

## Introduction

Conditionals control the control flow of a program and determine which blocks of code can run.

### Different types

* `if` statement where if `true`, allows code enclosed in the `if block` to run
* `else` statement where the code enclosed in the `else block` is run if the `if` statement is `false`
* `else if` statement is used to specify other conditions under the `if` statement that will only test if the `if` statement is false

This allows the computer to **take different actions** based on different input data.
