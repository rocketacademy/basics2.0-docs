# 3.3: Boolean Operators

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Understand that boolean operators expands on conditionals to add complexity to our programming logic.
* [ ] Know that there are three types of boolean operators.

## Introduction

### What are Boolean operators?

In programming, we want computers to make decisions based on input data. One way of evaluating multiple conditional statement is to chain them in a Boolean expression using Boolean operators that produces a **true** or **false** value when executed.

They are often used in `if` and `else if` statements to cover more conditions.

` if the input is 'palatable papaya'`` `` `**`or`**` `` ``'banana', you win. `

` if the dice roll is more than 3`` `` `**`and`**` `` ``odd, you win. `

` if the dice roll is`` `` `**`not`**` `` ``1, you win. `

There are several different boolean operators:

1. Equality `==`
2. Inequality `!=`
3. Or `||`
4. And `&&`
5. Not `!`
6. Greater than or Less Than `>` or `<`
7. Greater or Equals to `>=`
8. Less or Equals to `<=`

## Exercise

With reference to the [secret phrase](../3.2-conditionals/3.2.1-if-else-else-if.md#simple-conditional-example-secret-phrase) and [dice game](../3.2-conditionals/3.2.1-if-else-else-if.md#dice-game-logic) code examples, what are the boolean operators we can use for the scenarios above and how should we use them?
