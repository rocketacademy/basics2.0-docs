## More JavaScript Practice

## JavaScript with DOM

Khan Academy has a good set of follow-on lessons that will dovetail with the DOM material we covered here in [10.2](6-document-object-model/6.1-the-document-object-model.md) and [11](../coursework/in-class-exercises/bonus-dom.md).

## Javascript Programming

Khan Academy also has some fun lessons that are more focused around programming concepts and fun things to build.

## Computer Science Fundamentals

For a broader Computer Science overview of the field, **Harvard's CS50** is a good choice. This course is quite a bit more difficult than Basics and uses the C programming language, among others.

You can take the course through a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) at EdX: [https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) or, use the course materials separately: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/](https://cs50.harvard.edu)

## Building Real World Projects

If you're interested in how real-world software systems are built you can begin to learn about a modern set of libraries and tools you'd need to do that.

### Front-end

This Code Academy course is the closest to the material we've already covered that will show you how modern Front-end apps are built: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path)\
\
Note: Front-end here, refers to the browser, where we ran all of the code in Basics.

### Back-end

This Code Academy course covers the basics of Back-end JavaScript servers that you would need to know to deal with the internet, requests and handling data, like with the SQL language.
